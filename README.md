# NSF Proposal Template


## Preparing the proposal

You should primarily only need to edit files in the `sections` directory.  Please place your figures into `figures` directory.


## Building pdfs

Type `make` at a command prompt to build. Final files are output into the `output` directory.  No attempt is made to build suplementary files in Word format.


## Gotchas

### Budget

* Never include office supplies on any federal grant
* budget justification should explain all travel, but esp. needs to justify international
* No one at Harvard is paid "Summer" salary.  Always "Calendar".

### Ancillary Docs

* All NSF proposals require a "Data Management Plan"
* Collaborative grants usually require a "Coordination Plan"
* All NSF proposal budgeting for postdocs require a "Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan"
