In his role as PI on NSF EAGER Award IOS 0947777: ``A Novel Rodent Model for the Neurophysiology of Visual Object Recognition'' (09/09-09/11), {\bf Prof. Cox} developed infrastructure and performed experiments establishing the laboratory rat as a powerful new model system for studying the neurophysiological underpinnings of high-level visual recognition. This work resulted in one journal publication \cite{zoccolan:frontiers_2010}, with two more publications currently in preparation, and resulted in open source software and hardware being made available for novel experimental apparatus. This project also engaged two REU students, both of whom have gone on to pursue STEM careers.

As Co-PI on NSF Award IIS 0963668: ``Collaborative Research: Unlocking Biologically-Inspired Computer Vision: A High-Throughput Approach'' (09/10-09/13), {\bf Prof. Cox} has made significant contributions to advancing understanding of biologically-inspired machine vision algorithms, as well as making contributions to general high-performance computing techniques required for running them efficiently at scale.
While this project is still in ongoing, it has already resulted in eight peer-reviewed publications \cite{vig:eccv_2012, bergstra:inpar_2012, vig:icip_2012, pinto:fg_2011, pinto:bionetics_2010, pinto:gcg2, pinto:cvpr_ws_2011, pinto:imavis_2012, chiachia:bmvc_2012}.  To date, this project has engaged one REU student, and has supported the organization of a workshop at the IEEE CVPR 2011 conference designed to bring together the neuroscience and computer vision community.
