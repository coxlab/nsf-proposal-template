In his role as PI on NSF STTR \#0750485 (3/1/2007-2/28/2011) on Improving Privacy and Security of Biometrics Systems, \textbf{Dr. Scheirer} made significant advancements in biometric-based technology for security and privacy, leading to the only PayPal approved application using fingerprint technology for financial transactions. This project has engaged more than a dozen undergraduates at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (several as REU students), five UCCS graduate students, and two high school interns (both RAHSS students). It has led to several publications~\cite{biotoken-07, cracking, biocrypt, bipartite-icb-09, BKI-Wifs, scheirer_2012_bki}.

Under NSF Award IIS-1136370 (4/15/2011 - 3/31/2012) ``Group Travel Grant for the Doctoral Consortium at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition" \textbf{Dr. Scheirer} as PI organized the doctoral consortium event at CVPR 2011, the premier conference in the area of computer vision.
