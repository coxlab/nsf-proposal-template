% Your Bio should be divided into the following sections
% (a) Professional Preparation (education):
% Undergrad, Major, Year
% Graduate, Major, Year
% Postdoc, Area, Years-Inclusive
% (b) Appointments:  most recent first.
% (c) Publications:  5 related to the proposal, and 5 "Other Significant Publications"
% (d) Synergistic Activities (math-enhancing activities that were not
% part of your main job description, like editorial boards and
% conference organizing - any Math-related volunteer work.
% these are often similar to Broader Impacts

% (e) Collaborators & Other Affiliations: (use the following sections)
% list in alphabetical order, and include current affiliations parenthetically
% Collaborators and Co-editors: past 48 months.  If none, write "none"
% Graduate Advisors and Postdoctoral sponsors: (your own, no matter how long ago)
% Thesis advisor and postgraduate scholar-sponsor:  those you have advised
% in the past 5 years.
% Total number of graduate students advised: X (all time)
% Total number of postdoctoral scholars sponsored: Y (all time)
