\section*{Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources}

\subsection*{Major Equipment:}
Prof. Cox's laboratory possesses a dedicated-use heterogenous GPU compute cluster comprised of 10 nodes (with 22 GPUs total) housed in an air-cooled rack.  This cluster is soley available for use by lab personnel and collaborators.

Additionally, members of both labs have access to shared Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences compute resources, including Odyssey, a 17,000+ core cluster operated by Harvard's Research Computing Group.


\subsection*{Computer and Network:}
Prof. Cox's laboratory already possess appropriate personal workstations and computer equipment to achieve project goals. In addition, Harvard maintains a campus-wide gigabit ethernet network and provides general IT support to labs.


\subsection*{Physical Space and Office Support:}
Prof. Cox's laboratory occupies roughly 1,800 square feet in the Northwest Laboratory Building on the main Harvard campus, not including additional shared conference room and overflow office space.

The lab possesses sufficient office/desk space to house the project staff, along with standard facilities such as wired and wireless internet access, desks, phone, and locking filing cabinets for storing sensitive data.
